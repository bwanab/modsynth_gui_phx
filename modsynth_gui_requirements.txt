Please read the file ../sc_em/Claude.md. This contains the implementation details
for the backend of this project which is meant to be an editor/ide to allow for editing
the ../sc_em/examples/ json files and to enable playing the files in real-time and with midi
files.

There is a bad implementation of this in ../modsynth_gui2 which was build using the elixir Scenic
library. I have put screen shots in this directory:

In addition to putting the file on the screen, this implementation gives an example of playing
a midi file via the loaded synth network.

This gives a notion of what we want in this project. The synth files contain position data, but
they were made for a different screen and interface so they'll need to be adjusted.

Requirements:
1. Ablity to load a file. Then using mouse control, move the nodes around with the
connectors following along.
2. Reattach the connectors as I wish. In general, a connector should go from an audio output
to an audio input, and from a control output to a control input. Other connections should give a
warning, but allowed.
3. Add new nodes from a list of available node types. The node types are the list of supercollider
SynthDefs read from the synthdef directory.
4. Ability to play midi file as described above. Also, and likewise ability to attach an
external midi device and play it using the loaded synth network.

Nice to haves:

1. I'd like the nodes to be a lot more attractive than in the modsynth_gui2 implementation.
2. I'd like the connectors to look as much like real patch cords as possible. At the least, they
should not be straight lines, but curvy looking.

I'm sure I'll come up with more requirements later.

Please come up with an implementation plan to work with. Ask question for any ambiguities.
